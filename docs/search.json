    "text": "By the end of this module, students should be able to: - Define and differentiate between various spatial and functional concepts in community ecology. - Identify and explain the key processes shaping species assemblages. - Evaluate the evidence for deterministic vs stochastic community assembly. - Interpret diversity metrics, null models, and trophic structures. - Assess the implications of ecological structure for stability and resilience.\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding how communities and ecosystems are structured is a central question in ecology. A community is defined as a set of populations from different species that coexist in space and time, interacting with each other and being influenced by their environment. Community ecology, therefore, seeks to explain how these species are distributed, what processes structure their assemblages, and how they respond to environmental gradients.\nCommunities are not fixed entities; they can be defined across various spatial and organisational scales. For instance, one might consider a temperate meadow community, which contains within it legume-dominated patches, microbial consortia associated with those legumes, and ultimately nitrogen-fixing bacterial guilds. These nested hierarchies are key to understanding ecological patterns.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 1. Conceptual diagram of community assembly: dispersal, environmental filtering, and biotic interactions shape community composition.\nCommunity composition is shaped by several key processes:\n\nDispersal limitations: Species may be absent from a site not because conditions are unsuitable, but because they have not arrived.\nEnvironmental filtering: Abiotic factors (e.g., soil type, moisture, light) constrain which species can persist in a given habitat.\nBiotic interactions: Competition, mutualism, and predation further shape species assemblages.\nSpeciation and extinction: These processes determine the regional species pool over evolutionary time.\n\nThese ecological and evolutionary processes produce observable patterns, such as species richness gradients, successional trajectories, and diversity-productivity relationships.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 2. Schematic of niche differentiation along multiple resource axes (Götzenberger et al. 2012).\nSpecies coexistence is often facilitated by differentiation along environmental gradients such as light, nutrients, and water availability.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 3. Rank-abundance curves visualising relative species abundances.\nDiversity metrics can be visualised using such curves and calculated using Hill numbers, which provide intuitive measures of diversity.\n\n\n\n\n Figure 4.

    "text": "The classification of ecosystems is a foundational task in ecology.
